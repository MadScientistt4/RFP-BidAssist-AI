# RFP BidAssist AI – Backend Setup Guide

This repository contains the backend for **RFP BidAssist AI**, built for the EY Techathon.  
The backend uses **Python**, **FastAPI**, and **Google Gemini (google.genai)** to extract structured data from RFP PDFs.

This guide explains **how to set up the backend correctly**, especially when working with teammates.

## 🚨 IMPORTANT (Read This First)

⚠️ **Always `cd` into the `backend/` folder before creating a virtual environment or installing dependencies.**

Why?
- Keeps dependencies isolated to the backend
- Avoids conflicts with frontend or other projects
- Ensures consistent setup across all teammates
